## Running Tests with/without coverage 🧪

To run all unit tests use the following command (you can omit `--coverage|-c` to skip coverage report):

```sh
$ koality test --coverage
```

To also generate an HTML coverage report you can use the `--generate|-g` flag.
.

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report in HTML with Koality Tools.
$ koality test --coverage --generate
```

If you want to generate the report separately you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)


## Running POEditor commands. 🔤

If using POEditor for translations in a project, there are several helpful commands for downloading locales
and for also uploading terms to the project.

```sh
# This will download the locales into assets/locales/[locale].po
$ koality poeditor locales --key=[read API key goes here] --project=[project ID here] --locales=[path to locales file]
```

And for uploading terms:

```sh
# This will 
$ koality poeditor upload --key=[write API key goes here] --project=[project ID here] --file=[path where json file will be generated]
```
