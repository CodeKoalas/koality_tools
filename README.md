## Koality Tools

Generated by the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link] ü§ñ

---

## Getting Started üöÄ

The tools can be activated globally via:

```sh
dart pub global activate -sgit git@gitlab.codekoalas.com:internal/koality-tools.git
```

## Usage

```sh
# Setup command
$ koality setup

# Test command optioon
$ koality test

# POEditor download locales command
$ koality poeditor locales

# POEditor upload terms command
$ koality poeditor upload

# Kubectl command to clean pods
$ koality kubectl clean-pods --namespace my-namespace --status Evicted

# Show CLI version
$ koality --version

# Show usage help
$ koality --help
```

## Running Tests with/without coverage üß™

To run all unit tests use the following command (you can omit `--coverage|-c` to skip coverage report):

```sh
$ koality test --coverage
```

To also generate an HTML coverage report you can use the `--generate|-g` flag.
.

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report in HTML with Koality Tools.
$ koality test --coverage --generate
```

If you want to generate the report separately you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)


## Running POEditor commands. üî§

If using POEditor for translations in a project, there are several helpful commands for downloading locales
and for also uploading terms to the project.

```sh
# This will download the locales into assets/locales/[locale].po
$ koality poeditor locales --key=[read API key goes here] --project=[project ID here] --locales=[path to locales file]
```

And for uploading terms:

```sh
# This will 
$ koality poeditor upload --key=[write API key goes here] --project=[project ID here] --file=[path where json file will be generated]
```


## Running Kubectl commands. üïπÔ∏è

For some helpful kubectl commands, these are Koality scripts to help manage and maintain clusters.

```sh
# This will delete any pods within a namespace matching a specific status. (Status defaults to "Evicted")
$ koality kubectl clean-pods --namespace gitlab-managed-apps --status CrashLoopBackOff
```

```sh
# This will exec into any pod within a namespace matching text strings. (Namespace defaults to "gitlab-managed-apps" and
# can be configured in the .koality_config.json file)
$ koality kubectl exec --namespace gitlab-managed-apps safet
```
This will return a list of pods matching the passed text args (can pass multiple arguments, e.g. `safet grow cert` will return 
any pod matching any of those strings) and allow you to select the one you want to exec into.

```sh
# This will describe any pods within a namespace matching text strings. (Namespace defaults to "gitlab-managed-apps" and
# can be configured in the .koality_config.json file)
$ koality kubectl describe --namespace gitlab-managed-apps safet
```
This will return a list of pods matching the passed text args (can pass multiple arguments, e.g. `safet grow cert` will return 
any pod matching any of those strings) and allow you to select the one you want to describe.

## Running Parse Commands. ü™Ñ

For commands that deal with parsing the `pubspec.yaml file` the `parse` command can be used.

```sh
# This will read the pubspec.yaml file and parse the version (Defaults to writing to stdout)
$ koality parse version

# It can also write the version to a file
$ koality parse version -o /path/to/version.txt
```
